\description{
Creates figures and a report on nowcast and/or short-term forecast for a given
country. This uses Epinow2 package for estimation but allows more flexibility
in application relevant to who uses such as weekly data, report creation for policy
makers and the option to include only a forecast with no nowcast when reporting
delays are not expected or counts are derived from cumulative data with no back-corrections.
